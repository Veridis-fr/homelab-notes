# Homelab Notes

This repository contains documentation and notes from my personal homelab,
used to learn Linux, networking, and troubleshooting in a controlled environment.

## Learning Goals
- Linux system administration fundamentals
- Networking basics (TCP/IP, DNS, routing, troubleshooting)
- Virtualization concepts
- Defensive security fundamentals

## Repository Structure
- `environment.md` — Lab hardware and virtualization setup
- `notes/` — Technical notes and learning summaries
- `network/` — Networking experiments and documentation

## Disclaimer
All experiments are performed on my own lab environment.
This repository is for educational purposes only.
No external or unauthorized systems are tested.

This homelab evolves over time as I continue learning.
